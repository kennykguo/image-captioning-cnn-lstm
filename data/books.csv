  Pragmatic Thinking and Learning

    Introduction

  Software is imagined and created in our heads
  You don’t get taught, you have to learn
  Pragmatism is to do what works for you
  Wetware   human brain cells analogous to computer systems
  Speaking, thinking, writing and typing are different tasks and use different portions of the brain
  Always consider the context

    Journey from novice to expert

  Dreyfus model of skill acquisition: Five discrete stages through which one must pass on the journey from novice to expert
  Construct theory
  Event theories can be measured   verified and proven
  Construct theories are abstractions and only evaluated in terms of usefulness
  eg. the mind is an abstraction
  Its often difficult for experts to explain their actions at a fine level of detail
  It is hard to articulate expertise
  Novices need clear and context free rules to operate, which would render the expert ineffective
  As you move from novice to expert, your mental models, perception, and problem solving change
  Stage 1: Novices
      Specifically performing a skill results in change of thinking
      Novices are very concerned about success, have little experience to guide them, have uncertainty, don’t want to particularly learn, just want to accomplish a goal, do not know how to respond to mistakes, and are vulnerable to confusion
      They can be effective when given context free rules   When X happens, do Y.
      Novices are flummoxed with deciding which rules are relevant
      With context free rules, you can never specify everything fully (infinite regression)
      Rules should get you started
  Stage 2: Advanced beginners
      Start to break away from fixed rules, and task on their own but have difficulty troubleshooting
      They want information quick
      Can start using advice in the correct context based on similar situations but barely
      There is no big picture or unity
  Stage 3: Competent
      You can develop conceptual models and work with them
      You can troubleshoot problems and figure out how to solve novel problems you haven’t faced before
      Seek out advice and apply advice from experts to use effectively
      The competent seeks out to solve problems
  Stage 4: Proficient
      You need the big picture
      They want to understand the larger conceptual framework and don’t want anything oversimplified
      Proficient practitioners can correct previous poor task performance, reflect on how they have done, revise their approach, and perform better. This is not available before this stage
      You learn from other’s experiences
      You can apply maxims   proverbial and fundamental truths that can be applied to a situation at hand
      eg. “test everything that can possibly break”
      The proficient practitioner has the experience to apply judgment and figure out what maxims to apply, and what it means, *in context.*
      They know what happens next, and what needs to change, if anything.
      Proficient practitioners take advantage of agile methods
  Stage 5: Expert
      They are the primary sources of information in a field, and they continually look for better ways to do things
      Experts work by intuition, not by reason
      The expert knows the difference between irrelevant details and import details
  When you are not skilled, you are more likely to think you are an expert
  Second order incompetence   being unskilled and unaware of it
  Ignorance more frequency begets confidence than does knowledge
  When you become an expert, you become aware how little you know
  Rules ruin experts
  Race sheep, herd race horses
  Novices need to be given direction and herded. Agile development doesn’t work well on a team composed of solely novices/advanced beginners
  Practices can never be formalized, they must always be worked out in real time
  The three most important changes along the way include:
      Moving away from rules to intuition
      Change in perception   problems are no longer a collection of equally relevant bits, but rather one where only certain bits are relevant
      Change from being a detached observer to an involved part of the system itself
  Most people for most skills never get higher than advanced beginner
  Increase in skill increases metacognitive ability
  The recognizes patterns in context
  It takes a minimum of a decade to become an expert
  Effort is not enough, you need deliberate practice
      Well defined task
      Task is challenging enough, but doable
      Environment needs to supply informative feedback
      Provides opportunity for repetition and correction of errors
  Accept responsibility: Programmers often implement something they know is wrong, ignoring the warning signs. Feedback is necessary
  Accept the responsibility to NOT follow the rules if necessary
  No expertise without experience, and no substitute for experience. Experience can be more efficient and effective
  Imitate existing practice, slowly assimilate the tacit knowledge and experience over time, and then go beyond imitation and innovate
  Winners don’t carry losers   what value do you bring?
  The model is a tool, not a mirror
  Rules cannot tell you the most relevant activities to perform or the correct path, they are only to help you get started
  A model is not reality
  Problem solving can’t be formalized
  Formal models hinder creativity
  Experts are alienated
  Spelling too much detail
  Oversimplification of complex situations
  Typical usually never happens
  Reliance on rules should decrease as ability to judge increases
  Object Oriented Design is based on context that form relationships
  Novices need a problem space
  Learning to learn is subject to the Dreyfus model
  Memory → CPU  1 →CPU  2
  Linear processing style, and rich mode
  Rich mode is critical for intuition
  L mode contributes to actual input
  R mode is asynchronous
  Thoughts occur before words
  If you keep track of ideas, you’ll get more of them
  L mode is verbal, analytic and rational
  Many valid thought processes are not rational
  R mode is non verbal, non rational and holistic
  Synthetic learning   prototyping, and independent test units. Learn by building
  Competing on commoditization
  Attractive things work better
  Being happy broadens your thought process and brings more of the brain hardware online
  Artificial environments create artificial data
  Art comes not from creation, but the selection of infinite choices
  Pattern and intuition is key to becoming an expert
  Believe in plasticity of the brain to increase your ability
  Think your brain has more capacity for learning

    Get in your right mind

  To become more creative, activate more neural pathways
  Use tactile enhancement
  Cross sensory feedback   verbal, written, visual
  Change your environment
  Slightly altered state of consciousness that allows you to see well
  Give L mode a job it does not want
  R mode to L mode flow for learning
  Let R mode lead, then switch to L mode to “productize it”
  Creativity is limited when you memorize minor facts and not grasp the whole
  Create a shitty first draft
  Creativity is combining incompatible ideas
  Any software system should be guided by a metaphor
  For each image that crosses your mind, look at the image, try to see all details
  Describe it out loud, imagine the image with all five senses, and use present tense
  Morning pages   first thing in the morning, 3 pages long hand, do not censor anything and do not skip a day
  Unguarded brain dump
  Rather than preventing a bug, try to thing of ways to cause the bug
  Assuming one right answer, thinking a solution is not logical, all are mental locks

    Debug your mind

  We make decisions and solve problems based on faulty memory and emotional state
  Cognitive biases
      Anchoring   seeing an umber affects how you predict or decide a quantity
      Fundamental attribution error   ascribing other people’s behaviour to their personality   context dependent
      Self serving bias   protective bias and lack of taking responsibility for failure
      Need for closure   avoiding uncertainty
      Confirmation bias
      Exposure effect   prefer tools that are familiar even if they don’t work well
      Hawthorne effect   behaving differently when watched
      False memory   imagined events with real memory   every read is a write
      Symbolic reduction fallacy   avoid complexity
      Nominal fallacy   naming to reduce its complexity
  Platonic fold   idealized simplified forms leaves gaps
  Deferring decisions to the future, when you are more wise and knowledgable
  Humans are bad at trying to extrapolate future events from previous events   we assume that events form a more or less stable, linear progression with easily defined cause and effect
  Correlation is not causation
  Determining causation is a different beast than observing correlation
  General affinity
  Personality tendencies
  Hardware bugs
  Lead with intuition, follow with linear feedback

Learn deliberately

  Education is something drawn out of the learner
  Random approach leads to random results
  The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled
  Knowledge is not important   mental models, questions you asked, and your experiences are more relevant to your performance
  You need feedback to understand your progress
  A goal lis a desired state
  An objective is a something you do to get closer to a goal
  SMART   specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time boxed
  Treat your learning portfolio like an investment portfolio
      Have a plan, diversify, make an active not passive investment, and make a regular investment
  All knowledge investments have value
  Iterate your plan
  SQ3R   Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review
  Test driven learning

Manage focus

Beyond expertise


  Introduction

  Impressions are unconscious
  On the other hand, we have powerful intuitive abilities
  The situation provides a cue, the cue gives the expert access to information stored in memory, the information provides the answer   intuition is nothing less than recognition.
  Emotions  loom much larger in understanding of intuitive judgments
  When faced with a difficult question, we often answer the easier one one without noticing the substitution
  Fast thinking involves variants f intuitive thought, while slow thinking involves deliberate effortful thinking
  This book is about System 1, and its mutual relationship to System 2
  Our shortcomings come from confidence in believing what we know, and the ignorance of what we don’t
  Overconfidence is fed by the illusion of hindsight

  1.

System 1 affects the choices that System 2 makes

Seeing and orienting are functions of S1

We can be blind to the obvious and blind to our blindness

System 2 endorsed, and often takes the last word when the surroundings violate S1 judgment

S1 cannot be turned off

Conflict between an automatic reaction and intention to control it is common

S2 is in charge of self control

The optimal way to approach judgment is to recognize situations that have a more likely chance of error, and avoid them when the stakes are high. 

Anything that occupies space in your working memory reduces your ability to think

  2.

S2 is a lazy character

Dilation of the pupil is a good indicator for mental focus

We don’t have control of the effort of doing tasks   harder tasks require more fixed effort, easier tasks will require less effort

Analogy for a circuit and just enough electricity to do a task   S2 has “spare capacity”

Law of least effort applies to cognitive and physical assertion

Effort is a cost and laziness is our nature

Effort is required to maintain simultaneously in memory several ideas that require several actions

S2 can follow rules, compare objects, and choose

Rapid switching leads to more effort

Time pressure is also another driver of effort, the most effortful require you to think fast

Often, we commit our results to long term rather than overworking our working memory. 

  3.

S2 has a natural “stroll” like behaviour, and self control aswell as thought often draw on the same limited effort

Flow separates the two forms of effort being concentration on a task and the deliberate control of attention, you don’t need to do the latter, meaning you can dedicate more resources to the first

S1 has a greater influence on action, when S2 is busy

Self control requires attention and effort

S2 manages thoughts and behaviours

Ego depletion   the depletion of the pool of mental resilience

Exertion of self control is painful

A high demand on S2 requires self control

Ego depletion also counts as a loss of motivation

Ego depletion differs from a high cognitive load

The brain consumes more glucose during demanding tasks and when S2 is used, your blood sugar level drops

The effects of ego depletion can be undone by ingesting glucose

Restoring the level of available sugar in the brain prevents deterioration of performance

Fatigue and hunger are factors in making difficult decisions   often the brain will just choose an easier one

Many people are overconfident in believing their intuition is correct

When people believe in something, they will look for arguments to support it. S1 creates the conclusion first, then the argument

Memory is a function of S1

Deliberate search and check is a function of S2

High self control is linked to high intelligence

The ability to control attention and emotion is linked

The characters of judgment have different personalities. S1 is impulsive and intuitive, while S2 is capable of reasoning and is cautious. 

S2 has two different minds   one part deals with slow thinking and heavy computation. 

A rational person is engaged with closely avoiding biases, using S2 more

Rationality should be distinguished from intelligence

Superficial thinking is a flaw of rationality, not intelligence, and the ability for a mind to reflect upon experiences. 

  4.

You cannot stop S1’s actions

Associative activation   ideas lead to other ideas in a sequence of further activities   each element strengthens other elements

Words lead to reaction leading to emotion leading to action 

The coherence of the brain is the link of ideas   it links the past and prepares you for the future

You think with your body, not with your brain

Resemblance, contiguity in time and place, and causality

Most of associative thinking is unconscious, and we know far less about ourselves than we think we do

Ideas are primed by other ideas, causing a ripple effect

Ideomotor effect

Priming goes both aways, thinking of an idea leads to action, an action leads to thoughts

Priming goes with actions that represent an idea

Money primes individualism

Read by figuring out if you have heard that or not

  5.

Cognitive strain is the presence of having uncompleted tasks and the current output of effort

Priming, good mood, clear displays, and repeated experiences lead to cognitive ease

Familiarity has the quality of “pastness” which can misinterpreted as prior experience

Easier cognitive ease gives the sense of familiarity

S2 relies on the familiarity produced by S1

Illusions occur over judgment based on familiarity, from an ease of cognitive strain

Anything that leads to an easier cognitive load has the potential to lead to bias

If you cannot remember where a memory came from, you often go with the path of easier cognitive ease

To persuade, you must maximize legibility

Make your message memorable, put it simple, put it in verse (poetically)

People differentiate truth using cognitive ease   something that is linked by logic, comes from a trustable source, or through association

The sense of cognitive ease cannot be located to its origin easily

Cognitive strain leads to a greater use of S2

Mere exposure effect   something that is more familiar will be more likable

Survival instincts lead to people avoiding going out of their comfort zone

Creativity is associative memory that works exceptionally well

Mood has a powerful effect on cognitive performance   S1’s intuition

A happy mood loosens the control of S2 over performance   people become more creative and less vigilant but more prone to error

Cognitive ease is both a cause and effect (reciprocal to each other meaning one causes the other and so on)

  6.

S1 continuously updates a framework for the world, constructed by associations

There is a category of events that you expect passively, and are not surprised when they happen

Unexpected events become expectation after the first encounter

Associative coherence leads us to have logical biases, and cognitive ease   the norm theory   S1 has norms that detect anomalies and irregularities

S1 has the ability to understand language and recognize the range of plausible values or possibilities

Often, we attribute a large event to must have some causality in terms of consequences and causes

S1 is constantly creating and seeking coherence in our world of ideas

S1 has causality reasonings built in from birth

Religion is highly interconnected with S1’s desire to envision the division between the physical and immortal world

Situations often are applied with causal thinking, when they really need statistical thinking

  7.

Jumping to conclusions is efficient according to S1 if the conclusions are likely to be correct and a mistake is acceptable. Otherwise, S2 intervenes

Recent events and current context have the most weight in determining an interpretation

(Review pg. 80 again when not dying)

S1 does not keep track of alternatives it rejects

Uncertainty and doubt are left to the jobs of S2

Understanding a statement must begin with an attempt to believe it   knowing what the idea would signify if it was a true statement

S1 has the initial attempt to believe a statement without control

S2 unbelieves statements

When S2 is engaged, we will almost believe anything

S1 is gullible and biased, S2 is in charge of doubting and believing

Associate memory conforms to confirmation bias (different things will come to mind depending on what is asked)

S1 favors uncritical suggestions of the likelihood of extreme events

Positive test strategy   S2 also conforms to confirmation bias

The halo effect   one aspect of a person influences other aspects

The halo effect stacks up to make a person feel more or less of a good person for example

S1 falls under the halo effect and fills in the gap of people based on previous information   this means that first impressions are important and they have a highg weight

The best way to make interpret information is to do it isolated. Contextual information will always influence information’s interpretation and may lead to the halo effect

An activated idea is an idea that is brought to memory. S1 can only use activated ideas

S1 jumps conclusions when information is limited

S1 does not consider the quality or quantity of information

**What you see is all there is (WYSIATI)**

There more you know, the harder it is for you to jump conclusions

WYSIATI causes S1 often to be overconfident and S1 often skims over the fact that something is missing

WYSIATI falls into framing bias and S1 can interpret the same information based on context evoked, differently

  8.

S1 has been shaped by evolution to provide a continuous assessment of the problems that must be solved for survival

**Good mood and cognitive ease are the human equivalents of assessments of safety and familiarity**

An imperfect ability of S1 to assess can still lead to a survival advantage

Competence is often judged by combining strength and trustworthiness

S1 has the ability to transcend patterns of intensity across different “dimensions” of information, however, this can leave us to feeling cognitive ease and thus, heuristic biases




    Techniques

  Try this   Go on a picture walk   scan through and look briefly at the pictures, captions and diagrams
  Look at the section headings, bold words, and summary and questions at the bottom
  Allows you to organize information
  Rubber duck method
  Eat your frogs   get started on the most difficult concepts first
  Blink, shift your attention, and double check your answers   “Does this really make sense?”, trick your mind into looking at the test again with fresh eyes.
  Create a shutdown ritual
  Active recall note taking

   Switch between convergence and divergence

  Like a pinball machine, you must hit the ball up again and again. When the balls are tightly packed, they leave trails, which are landmarks for your brain to complete tasks again, with greater efficiency. When the balls are loose, they allow for more entropy, and thus more creativity.
  Sometimes we need to lose concentration so we can think more clearly
      Sometime you need to be less focused so that you can be a better learner
  Your brain has to go back and forth between diffuse modes and focus to learn effectively
      You need to go back and forth between material in order to learn
  Your brain can only be in one mode at a time
      Your thought process can diffuse in diffuse mode

    Convergence mode

  Focused mode   A mode of thinking to get into when trying to learn something new, you need to focus intently   eyes on the prize. To focus means to intently zone in on something
      You make trails in your brain when you’re focused
  Engage in active learning during focus mode
  The more you practice commanding your focus, the better you’ll get at focusing
      Focus and memorization reinforce each other

    Divergence mode

  However, to solve problems, you need to focus first before diffusing
  Diffuse mode   A mode of relaxation and you’re not thinking about anything in particular   helps you make imaginative connections between ideas   eyes on the flies
  When you relax your mind and focus on nothing in particular, the solution comes easy
      You need to take a break for diffuse mode to work
  Switch to diffuse mode by doing different tasks, for creativity
      Sleep is the ultimate diffuse mode
      When in diffuse mode, your brain works on the problem in the background
      Best diffuse methods are through sleeping, exercising, or walking

   Building good habits

  You need enough time to focus, and enough time for diffusion
      Do something that very different from what you have been focusing on

    Avoid procrastination by getting started

  When you put something off, it hurts your brain, get going and it will stop the pain that comes with doing difficult things
  Practice and time go hand in hand
  To become a good learner, just get going
      Shut off all distractions
  Pomodoro technique

    Active recall as much as possible

  Active recall   bringing an idea back to mind
  Look away from the paper and see what you can recall

    No multitasking

  Your focus can only be on one thing at a time
      When you constantly switch tasks, you waste energy and time
  Habits are like zombies
      Replace bad zombies with good zombies

   The physical brain

    Neuron analogy

  Each neuron is a tiny mini computer, connected by synapses
  Axon   arm of a neuron
  Brain links   neurons that often fire together
  Dendrite   legs of a neuron   dendrite spines receive signals from other neurons
  Synapse   small gap between neurons
  Neuron aliens shock other neuron aliens to pass a message, the more often one path is shocked, the more stronger the connection
  Neurons that fire together wire together

    Neuroplasticity and deliberate practice

  Neuroplasticity   the fact that your brain grows and changes
      Neurons change while we go to sleep
      Brain links solidify while you’re sleeping
          During sleep, the brain rehearses what it has learned during the day
  You need meaningful practice and to take things slowly
      You need to practice with what you’ve just learned
      The most boring thing would be if the teacher did all the work for you, leaving you with nothing to do
      You need to take responsibility in creating your own understanding
  Neural reuse theory   using ideas you have already learned to assist you in learning new ideas
  Dendrite growth is a lie detector   they will only grow if you’ve been really focusing
      Concentrating intently can also spur new connections from larger dendrites
      Use them or lose them, dendrite spines shrink when they are not used
          Good learning is like a brick wall, held together by mortars that are dried during sleep
      When you learn something new, you want to revisit it soon before the dendrites start fading
  Brief practice sessions over a number of days are better for storing information

   Make your memory as efficient as possible

    Working memory and long term memory

  Your brain uses two systems   working memory, and long term memory
  Your working memory is your prefrontal cortex
  Your prefrontal cortex can only hold about 4 things at a time
  If you don’t focus you won’t hold information
  Each piece of information is a set of brain links, simple information forms brain links and complicated information forms nets of brain links
  Long term memory is scattered throughout your brain

    Turn facts into pictures

  Your memory locker also has a toothpaste tube
      Facts are like toothpaste that muse be squeezed into the tube
  If your information is a picture, it will be easily taped to the wall

    Interlinked information is remembered

  Anchor your information with something you already know well
  Recall most often in the beginning, but less often as time goes by
  Memory palace   associate bizarre things with things in your house
      The brain is good at remembering visual ideas, due to the visuospatial memory
      Link randomness to things you know well
      Use a metaphor, take good notes, imagine you are the object you are trying to remember

    Link your information to strengthen your working memory

  Your working memory creates brain links in stages:
    1. First your working memory figures out a new concept
    2. You practice using the new concept and create brain links   connected pattern in your long term memory (dendrite spines and synapses link up)
    3. The prefrontal cortex can easily pull out information with a lot of brain links, and still hold onto other pieces of information at the same time
    4. Brain links can be linked into other sets of brain links, and you can pull longer chains of information.

    Exercise and sleep well to improve long term memory

  Learning produces new neurons in the hippocampus
  During sleep, information is transferred from information from your hippocampus into the neurons of the cerebral cortex (outer layer of the brain)
      Sleep also clears out the hippocampus for new learning, and also new synaptic connections
      During sleep, new brain links in the hippocampus from learning will help make long term memory in the cerebral cortex stronger
  During exercise, BDNF is released (brain derived neurotrophic factor), making them more likely to connect with other neurons
      BNDF also acts like food for synapses and dendrite spines, making them grow larger
      Serotonin and dopamine help you come up with new ideas and link ideas together (released from exercise)

   Practice well

    Understanding and practice go together

  Enjoyment comes with mastery   plateau point
  Trying too hard to understand may result in worse decision and more difficulty in making problems
      You must practice before viewing a concept through different hats or perspectives
  The working memory octopus only works when you’re focused and has only four arms
      Strong brain links are necessary for processing complex information
      Distractions use up an arm of the octopus
  Cognitive load   the amount of mental effort being used in working memory
      It’s important to form long chains of brain links because cognitive load is limited
      Focus needs to be uninterrupted to create brain links   avoid task switching in the middle of tasks
  You need to practice   learning comes to life when you do something with information

    Avoid lazy learning and complete deliberate practice

  Focus on the material that is most difficult
      Brain links go away when there is no difficult practice
  Practice choosing between techniques in technical situations   **interleaving**
      Helps you see the difference between a variety of topics when you need it
  Practice your skills over a number of days actively so that synaptic brain links form
  Skills need to be practiced separately and then interweaved
      Good writing is built from brain links
  Action   make a task list for yourself for the next day

    Have variety

  The place you study will help your memory, but this may be a curse in disguise   you should study in a variety of places
      Recall your long term memory without references to the location of where you learned a piece of information
          Recall as much as you can, that’s what you’re doing on tests
  You should not rely on a preferred learning style   you should use several different methods of learning
  Rut think   your mind gets used to running along certain neural pathways that it can’t easily change anymore
      The way to get better is to strike out in a completely different direction
  Transfer   brain links you create in one area can allow you to more easily build brain links in another
  A poor working memory can be a better creativity memory, and force you to simplify ideas (benefit) due to a lower amount of objects that can processed in your prefrontal cortex
      Slow learners can learn more deeply than fast learners because they spend more time throughout the process

   Miscellaneous

    Be your own scientist studying you

  Observe yourself from the ceiling
  You need to spot out what works best for you

    Checklist for exams & tests

  Positivity over avoiding punishment
  Don’t follow your passion, broaden your passion
  Learn a topic deeply, but also broaden your passions
  When you are wrong, admit it, and change your mind without denial


    Executive summary

Mental models are important ways to effectively navigate through live. Not only by solving problems, mental models also help us avoid problems. Building a lattice of mental models allows us to see our blind spots, and constantly be grounded in reality, when moving through the chaos of life. 

1. Maps are not the best representation of reality
2. To know your circle of competence, is to know what you know, and know what you don’t know
3. Deriving first principles means to separate what is non-reducible, and thus true
4. Thought experiments allow us to test situations, and they must be done with scientific rigour
5. What is necessary comes before what is sufficient
6. First, second, and third order consequences don’t always have a correlation to each other
7. It is important to consider context before judgment
8. Start from the end, and get to the start
9. The simple models have the lowest number of variables
10. Intent cannot be assumed, and stupidity usually comes first

    Introduction

 Remove your blind spots, avoid problems, minimize risk to limit stress and increase choices
 To avoid problems, just as much as solve problems through different dimensions
 Mental models are subconscious and they simplify the world
 Mental models allow you to break things down, and understand the full scope of a situation
 The more lenses on a problem the more reality reveals itself
     Multiple lenses are important for complicated problems
 Memory models are contiguous because the universe works in the same way
 Understanding must constantly be tested with reality
     Keep contact with the earth
     Test ideas out in the real world
 Failure to update reality comes from wrong perspective or vantage point, denial from ego and distance from the consequences of our actions:
    1. We have a hard time seeing any system we are in (variables have to recognizes consciously)
    2. Ego affects our perception of reality because we are afraid of being wrong and we are invested in defending ourselves
         Stress and anxiety are caused when we double down on seeing the world the way we want to see it
    3. The farther a consequence is, the more likely we keep our beliefs
         No reflection causes no learning causes mistakes, leading to a cycle of wasting time
         Updating beliefs is painful
 The degree to which mental models explain reality is the degree they improve our thinking, they help us avoid consequences and allow us to see higher consequences
     We cause things, things don’t just happen to us
         When things happen in accord with our view of the world we naturally think they are good for us and others, while when they are wrong, we think they are bad
     Problems with mental models  wrong model or applied during the wrong time or situation  fit into a trap of knowing if the model fits into reality or not
 An engineer thinks in terms of systems, a psychologist thinks in terms of incentives, and a business person thinks in terms of opportunity cost and risk-reward.
     Each person has blind spots
     The goal should be to have a variety of mental models for multiple disciplines and then have the right wisdom to apply the correct one
         Learn and apply, learn what types of situations to apply which
 The larger and more relevant the sample size, the more reliable the model  in organic systems such as math, organic systems such as biology, and human history
     Better models make better descriptions through better understanding
     The more information a model can cover, the more accurate of a representation of reality the model is
 The way we are now is not how we always were, considering how history evolved over time is crucial
 Facts must connect together through lattices of mental models. The world does isolate itself into discrete disciplines
     Synthesizes the borders of knowledge
     Consider the entire truth, not just the partial truth

    1. The map is not the territory

 The best map is not reality, they are merely abstractions (simpler ideas)
     Maps are only useful to the extent they are explanatory and predictive
 A map is a reduction of reality and they can also be a snapshot of a point in time
     Maps are tools that simplify territory
         If the aim becomes simplification rather than understanding we start to make bad decisions
     A map is an abstraction, an abstraction loses relevant detail for simplicity
     Rules for a map cannot apply to a constantly changing world, we need to adapt
 The territory is the actual reality the map is a simplified representation, they don’t always agree with each other. They have limits
 A problem occurs when our knowledge pertains to the map instead of the territory
 All maps are not dogma (principles laid out to be true), and they are not meant to be used forever
 If the value of a map or model is related to its ability to predict or explain, then it needs to represent reality, including changes
 It is important to understand what your map can cover, and what its limitations are
 1. Reality is the ultimate update
     Territories change, sometimes faster than the maps and models that describe them
     Update by feedback loops
 2. Consider the cartographer
     Models are useful when we consider the context and purpose of it from its creator
 3. Maps can influence territories
 To think a few steps ahead is to think beyond the map

    2. Circle of competence

 To understand your circle of competence, is to know what you know, and know what you also don’t know
1. What is a circle of competence?
    1. In our circle of competence, you are a Lifer, not a Stranger
    2. Be a Lifer, not a Stranger (a person that seeks specialized knowledge)
2. How do you know when you have one?
    1. Within our circle of competence, we know exactly what we do not know. Knowing what is knowable and what is unknowable
    2. We are able to solve problems in our circle, efficiently
3. How do you build and maintain one?
    1. A circle of competence is dynamic, just as the information in the world is also constantly changing
    2. Learning comes when experience meets reflection
    3. Monitor your circle of competence with truth
    4. You can't improve if you don't know what you're doing wrong
    5. Have an outside perspective to help you, avoids bias
    6. When we are outside of our circle of competence, we are not well equipped to make decisions.
4. How do you operate outside of one?
    1. Learn at least the basics, acknowledge you are a stranger, not a lifer.
    2. Get help from the people who have a strong circle of competence. Ask for advice
 It is important to know a person's incentives for an area that they are competent in
 Our circle of competence has a limit and cannot include everything. Identify your circle and know how to move around outside it
 Falsifiability: if you cant prove something wrong, you can't prove it right either
     A statement must have a degree of risk to be proved incorrect/wrong for it to exist as something that can be proved correct
     Applying the filter of falsifiability helps people sort for robust theories, proving them their probability to be true if they cannot be tested

    3. First principles thinking

 A tool to help clarify complicated problems by separating the underlying idea or facts from any assumptions based on them  what remains are the essentials
     Knowledge can only be built when we are actively trying to falsify it (prove it wrong)
 First principles do not provide a checklist for things that are always true; they are the foundation on which to build
     First principles identifies the elements that are non-reducible.
 They are the boundaries that you have to work with in any given situation
 Everything not a law of nature, is just a shared belief
     Learn to take things apart, test your assumptions, reconstruct them
 If we want to identify the principles to cut through dogma, we can use Socratic questioning, or the Five Whys
     Socratic questioning:
         Establish truth, reveal assumptions, separate knowledge from ignorance
            1. Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?
            2. How do I know this is true? What if it were the opposite?
            3. How can I back this up?
            4. What might others think? How do I know I am correct?
            5. What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?
            6. Why did I think that? Was I correct?
            7. What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?
     Five Whys:
         Land on a “what” or a “how”
         Systematically delving further into a statement or concept so that you can separate reliable knowledge from assumption
 When dogma is taken for truth, you can overlook the reasons that the dogma can be false
     To improve on something, we need to understand why it is successful or not
 Understand the rationale behind first principles, before you rely on other people’s tactics
     You can change the tactics if you know the principles
     The way things are might not be the way things have to be
 The man that grasps principles can select methods, the man that selects methods without understanding principles is sure to have problems

    4. Thought experiment

 Creativity is intelligence having fun
 Devices of the imagination used to investigate the nature of things
     Used to examine what can be known, opens up exploration, and help us avoid mistakes
     Explore situations from more angles than you can physically examine and test for
 Thought experiments require rigor like a scientific method. Thought experiments are not daydreams:
    1. Ask a question
    2. Conduct background research
    3. Construct hypothesis
    4. Test with thought experiments
    5. Analyze outcomes and draw conclusions
    6. Compare to hypothesis, and adjust accordingly
 Imagine physical impossibilities, re-imagining history, intuiting the non-intuitive
     Historical counter-factual, and semi-factual (If Y happened instead of X, what would be the outcome?)
     History is a chaotic system, a small change in the beginning conditions can exponentially grow to vastly different outcomes down the line
         Important to be rigorous with the scientific method to gain useful conclusions
 Solve problems with intuition and logic that cannot be demonstrated physically
     How did X lead to Y?
     You can analyze how smart or stupid your own decisions are, regardless of outcome
     Thought experiments allow us to verify if our natural intuition by running experiments to make a clear point
 Use thought experiments to realize unrealized outcomes and see what could have occurred within the limits we have
     Thought experiments let us figure out what we value in life and where to focus our energies
     Identify the decisions and actions that had impact
 Thought experiments cannot predict chaotic systems well
     The more scenarios you can imagine where nothing changes when you change a variable, the weaker the correlation of it being a critical cause.
     Thought experiments tell you the limits of what you know and the limits of what you should attempt
 You become aware of your process so that if your results are good, and you play to logic and strategy, instead of luck
 Veil of ignorance  ignore your initial intuition of what is likely to be fair, and challenge these beliefs

    5. Necessity vs sufficiency

 There is a gap between what is necessary to succeed, and what is sufficient
     What is necessary, always comes before what is sufficient
 In mathematics, sets of conditions necessary for be successful is part of the set sufficient to be successful.
     The sufficient set is far larger than the necessity set

    6. Second-order thinking

 Second-order thinking is thinking far ahead, as well as holistically (considering everything as a whole)  considering the consequences of the consequences, and so on
 Short term gain vs long-term pain
     Is what we are doing now going to get the results of what we want
     Going for immediate payoff usually guarantees a one-off interaction  trust and reputation are built long-term
 First-order consequences can be good, while second and third can be bad, and first-order can be bad, while second and third can be good
     The law of unintended consequences  not factoring in the second level of effects
     Everything affects everything, things are not produced and consumed in vacuum
 Can be used to avert problems and anticipate challenges that you can then address in advance
 Although valuable, avoid the Slippery Slope Effect  the idea that if we start with an action, everything after causes B, C, D, and E.
     Second and subsequent effects can only go so far, it is important to focus on evaluating the most likely causes and effects
 Ask yourself: And then what?
 A little time spent thinking ahead can save us massive amounts of time later.

    7. Probabilistic thinking

 Probability is a tool to make sense of the unknown and uncontrollable
 Using math and logic to calculate the likelihood of a specific outcome
 Accurate thinking enhances precision, effectiveness
 Our best method is to estimate the future since we cannot be certain of it
1. Bayesian thinking
    1. Given limited but useful information, we should take into account as much of what we know, when we learn something new, to make the best possible predictions
    2. Bayes Theorem  the probability of event A happening, given that B has happened, is equal to the probability of event B happening given that A has happened, multiplied by the probability of both events occurring together, divided by the sum total for all probabilities. 
        1. You need:
            1. Prior (contextual information the most important)
            2. Evidence and its likelihood of another probability you want to analyze
    3. Context is key
    4. Your context itself is also a probability: called the likelihood ratio or Bayes factor.
    5. Cycle of challenging and validating what you believe you know
    6. Conditional probability:
        1. Observing the context to see if it creates an independent probability, or dependent probability. 
        2. Bayes formula is derived from conditional probability formulas. However, as formula itself, it connects two different conditional probabilites. 
2. Fat-tailed curves
    1. Aka. normal distribution
    2. Fat-tailed curves are not bell curves. Normal distributions can extend forever
        1. The more extreme events that are possible, the higher chance that one will occur
        2. The tails mean everything
    3. It is critical to deal with fat-tailed curves in the right way because they leave us with a wildly unpredictable future
3. Asymmetries
    1. Metaprobability  the estimate of your estimates
     Orders of magnitude  any inaccuracy with an extreme event can cause calculations to be way off
     Anti-fragility: Three categories of objects
         Ones harmed by volatility and unpredictability
         Ones neural to volatility and unpredictability
         Ones that benefit from it
             Some entities can thrive in unpredictability
         Predicting is impossible, its more better to prepare
         Fail temporarily  learn how to learn from your failures, and never take a failure that would put yout out of the game
             Failure comes with the antifragile gift of learning
             What you learn makes you less vulnerable to the volatility of our world
     Upside-down optionality  seeking out situations that have good odds of offering opportunities  seek to increase your odds of opportunity
     There are more probability estimates on the over-optimistic side than the under-optimistic side (meaning you are likely to overestimate than underestimate)
     Probabilistic thinking has its limits
     Identify what matters, determine the odds, check your assumptions, make a decision
     Causation vs correlation:
         Not all correlations are causations
         No correlation: correlation coefficient (between 0 and 1) should be close to 0
         Perfect correlation (correlation of 1)
         Weak to moderate correlation (Between 0 and 1) and suggests other factors are at play
         If you have trouble dealing with causation vs correlation, invert the variables (dependent and independent). If the inverse is true, then it is most likely just a correlation
         Regression to the mean  the tendency for extreme scores to move to the mean over repeated measurements. The best appears to get worse, the worst appears to get better (extremes soften when correlation is imperfect). This means the best correlation gets worse, and the worst correlation gets better (often extremes are influenced by randomness and taking more measurements will cause the correlation to “regress” to the average.
             Fallacies in the extremes can lead to causations. This is why control groups (variables are fixed) to be measured and determine if effects are real, or just due to variability.
             Without a control group, you can never have a perfect measure
            

    8. Inversion

 “Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.”  Sun Tzu
 Invert  turn upside down
 Approach a situation from the opposite end of the natural starting point
     Instead of thinking forward, think backward
 “Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance”
 Start by assuming that what you want to prove is true or false, then show what else would have to be true. Assume true, then prove by counter example.
     Think deeply about what you want to avoid and see what options are leftover.
     Start at the end, move to the start.
     If it were the case, what would it look like?
 Forcefield analysis  any situation where change is desired, management of that change requires inversion
    1. Identify the problem
    2. Define your objective
    3. Identify the forces supporting the change to your objective
    4. Identify the forces that impede changes towards the objective
    5. Strategize a solution
 Inversion leads to innovation
 Consider the opposite angle to solve a problem
 Identify not only what to do to improve outcomes, but what to do to stop making things worse
     Instead of thinking how to fix a problem, think about how to prevent it from happening

    9. Occam’s Razor

 “A plurality is not to be posited without necessity”
 Creativity is making the complicated simple
 It is human nature to overthink, stress, and overcomplicate
 Simple explanations are more likely to be true than a complicated one
     Unnecessary complexity fills gaps that will eventually uncover
 We should prefer the simplest explanation with the fewest moving parts
     They are easier to falsify, understand, and more likely to be correct
     As you increase the variables, the greater the probability for error
     Occam’s Razor is used to avoid wasting time, resources, and energy
 Use when you have two competing things, of equal aspects in explanations, the simple solution suffices
     On the other hand, sometimes, some things may not be that simple
         The Razor does not create simplicity out of the complex. If something cannot be reduced, you must deal with it as is
         Something can only be simplified to the extent it can still provide an accurate understanding

    10. Hanlon’s Razor

 Men are constrained by necessity (limitations, societal pressure, etc), and build up rationalizations to account for their acts
 “Do not attribute to malice, that which is more explained by stupidity”.
 People make mistakes and you need to ask if there was another possibility for a sequence of events
     Look for options instead of missing opportunities
 The explanation most likely to be right contains the least amount of intent
     The fallacy of conjunction  you cannot assume a person’s intent unless you have concrete evidence
 When we see something we don’t like happen, that seems wrong, we assume its intentional. It’s more likely that it was completely unintentional
     Over concluding that violates logic, and confirmation bias
 When we are in defense mode, we avoid dealing with the perceived threat and reduce our vision, blinding us from the big picture
